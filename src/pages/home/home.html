        The purpose of this app is to inform the Clinicians of what is routinely stocked by
        the Avenues Clinic Pharmacy Department. When stocks are running low, the Department will
        inform the clinical areas as the initial communication. When stocks have run out where we cannot source stock
        from our wholesalers as they will also be out of stock, we will also communicate via an internal Memo.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
          Stocks which we do not hold in large quantities will be marked with a ***.
          Before prescribing, the clinician will need to inform the
          Pharmacist of the impending need so that the patient’s need can be catered for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stocks which we make in the
          Pharmacy as a substitute for products that used to be available will be marked with a *.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stock items where we practice Just-In-Time purchasing are
          marked with ** being items which have a very short shelf life or have an erratic consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stock items which are part of the Private
          Public Partnership initiatives with the Ministry of Health and Child Care will be marked with a ^^

        The Pharmacy Department does not stock TB medication.
        Patients that need to be initiated are ordered for on the forms provided located in the wards.
        The pharmacy department will go and collect on behalf of the patient from
        Wilkins Hospital between 8am and 4pm on week days and between 8am and 12pm on Saturdays.

      <h3>Antiretrovirals (Section 1.5)</h3>
      <p>
        The Pharmacy Department’s antiretroviral stocks are limited to Prevention of Mother
        To Child Transmission (including test kits) and Post Exposure Prophylaxis agents for staff members.
        It does not stock routine ARVs for patient dispensing.
        It is encouraged that patient should bring their own ARVs or the relatives
        arrange for the patient’s own drugs to be given to the nurses.
        However, if a patient is admitted without their own medication the
        Clinician should leave a prescription for the Pharmacy to obtain a quotation.
        Pharmacy will use this quotation to obtain consent from the patient who will
        then pay for the medication upfront. They will however be receiving a month’s supply,
        and this can only be done between 8am and 5pm. </p>
